    <!-- We use a blank 9-patch here to work around a bug in the android framework. A subtle problem
    in LayerDrawable means that if it is composed of simple drawable objects, it will reset the
    padding of it's host view when set as the background. Using a 9-patch means that we can 'hard-
    code' the padding we want into the 9 patch, so when it resets its host views padding it doesn't
    actually change it. (drawable/corpus_indicator_bg uses layer drawables to composite an arrow
    on top of these basic background). See bug 2826716. -->
